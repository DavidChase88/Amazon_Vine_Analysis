The purpose of the analysis is to determine if there is any bias toward members of the paid Amazon Vine Program in the wireless products segment.

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions:

### How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?

There were 613 Vine reviews and 64,968 non-Vine reviews for a total of 65,581 reviews.

### How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

There were 222 5 star Vine reviews and 30,543 non-Vine reviews.

### What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

36.22% of Vine reviews were 5 stars compared to 47.01% or non-Vine reviews were 5 stars.

## Summary: In your summary, state if there is any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Use the results of your analysis to support your statement. Then, provide one additional analysis that you could do with the dataset to support your statement.

For this wireless product there does not appear to be any positivity bias in the Vine program. In fact, there is a higher percentage of 5 star reviews for non-Vine wireless products (47.01% vs 36.22%). However, this is just one product and doing a test among a larger array of Amazon products would give us a better idea of what is going on as one product is not enough data to determine if the Vine program has a positivity bias. We should repeat this analysis across more Amazon products.
